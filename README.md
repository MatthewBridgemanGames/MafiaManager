An android app to help narrators play the party game "Mafia"

Created by Matthew Bridgeman

Mafia has been one of my favorite games but found it time consuming for narrators during nighttime to record what each person done. This is an android app to help narrators throughout the entire process and eliminate the need for a spreadsheet or paper. Some roles require the narrator to control how often they use their role.

Roles:
Sheriff (Town) - Invesitagates one person each night.
Doctor (Town) - Can protect one person each night from death.
Veteran (Town) - Can go on "alert". While on alert, they will attack anyone who attempts to visit them.
Mayor (Town) - Can reveal they are the mayor and have increased voting power while lynching players during the day.
Vigilante (Town) - Can attack one player each night.
Mafioso (Mafia) - Can attack one player each night.
Witch (Mafia) - Can prevent one player from using their ability each night.
Jester (Independent) - Wins if they get lynched.
